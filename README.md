## Overview

**Legion AI** spawning represents a significant shift in how we approach Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It is not just a multi-agent system—it is a collaborative platform where autonomous agents work together to tackle complex, real-world problems that require multi-faceted reasoning and iterative refinement. The goal of this project is to build a foundation where machine cognition can progress toward independent, self-directed thought.

In the current AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) landscape, large-scale language models have transformed how we interact with and utilize AI. Open-source local language models are at the forefront of this transformation. These models offer a more accessible alternative to proprietary systems, and they can be customized and integrated into complex systems such as **Legion AI**, where multiple agents are required to collaborate on solving advanced problems.

The purpose of **Legion AI** is to address the limitations of current reasoning models by creating an environment of **collaborative reasoning**. Here, agents are dynamically spawned and work together to provide deeper, more refined solutions to complex queries. Unlike traditional AI models that work in isolation, the agents in Legion AI represent a variety of knowledge domains and engage in back-and-forth reasoning, critiquing, and refining each other's ideas until a comprehensive solution is reached.

### The Role of Open-Source Models in AGI Development

Open-source models like LLaMA 3.1: 8B, as demonstrated in the provided code sample, have shown remarkable versatility across various tasks, including text generation, commonsense reasoning, and symbolic reasoning. These models are optimized for performance across a diverse range of applications, and their open-source nature enables the broader community to contribute to ongoing enhancements and innovations.

By integrating small, open-source local language models, Legion AI fosters an environment that emphasizes accessibility and collaboration. This approach aims to combine these models to form an advanced reasoning capability, regardless of training data size or model trimming methods used. It aligns with the project's mission to advance toward AGI through community-driven research, rather than depending on large proprietary, commercial models.

### Why Collaboration Matters

The limitations of modern NLP systems go beyond just the need for large datasets. These systems encounter significant challenges when it comes to tasks that demand true reasoning, commonsense understanding, and cognitive flexibility—skills that go far beyond pattern recognition or memorization. Complex tasks such as commonsense reasoning, arithmetic, symbolic manipulation, and abstract problem-solving reveal that merely scaling models is not enough to unlock their full potential. To overcome these challenges, systems must develop nuanced reasoning abilities that are more likely to emerge through multi-agent collaboration rather than from singular, monolithic models.

Legion AI seeks to address these challenges by testing and applying current theories of human reasoning, especially those inspired by concepts like Global Workspace Theory (GWT) and Integrated Information Theory (IIT). GWT suggests that human cognition works by integrating various cognitive processes, similar to a "global workspace" where information is shared across multiple areas, enabling complex reasoning and decision-making. IIT, on the other hand, focuses on how consciousness and thought arise from the integration of information across networks, reflecting the complexity and depth of human cognition. By mimicking these processes, Legion AI aims to replicate this sophisticated form of reasoning in local AI systems.

Legion AI uses multi-agent spawning systems that are not static but constantly evolving. These agents are spawned from the data they have already collected and built upon, gradually learning and adapting to become smarter and more capable over time. Each agent collaborates with others, contributing to a collective intelligence that continuously grows. As these agents develop, their ability to handle complex tasks and engage in advanced problem-solving increases, leading to the emergence of more sophisticated reasoning abilities. This process mirrors the evolutionary nature of intelligence, where multi-agent systems give rise to smarter and smarter agents by building upon the experiences and knowledge of their predecessors.

By fostering this emergent, evolutionary approach to AI, Legion AI aims to create systems capable of advanced, human-like reasoning. The goal is to transcend mere data memorization and pattern recognition, leading AI toward adaptive, autonomous problem-solving across multiple domains. This process not only pushes the boundaries of what NLP systems can achieve but also brings AI closer to the ultimate goal of developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), where models can reason, learn, and operate independently in a wide range of fields.

**Legion AI** aims to:

1. **Decompose complex problems** into manageable tasks, enabling agents to collaborate on each step of the solution.
2. **Provide a more interpretable window** into AI reasoning, allowing users to debug and refine the reasoning process as they observe the interactions between agents.
3. **Extend beyond typical tasks**, making it applicable to any domain where collective human expertise can be replicated through agent spawning.

### Moving Beyond Current Approaches

While open-source local lanaguage models have demonstrate the promise of few-shot learning, their ability to perform high-level reasoning is significantly enhanced in **Legion AI**. By creating an environment where agents not only collaborate but also learn from each other, the system refines ideas through back-and-forth reasoning through different reasoning methods.  Imagine a future where agents in **Legion AI** represent experts in different fields, collaborating to solve business challenges, optimize machine learning models, or create new scientific theories. These agents are not just executing pre-programmed instructions—they are reasoning, critiquing, and iterating to reach a collective decision.

### Applications of Legion AI

The applications of **Legion AI** are broad and span multiple industries. Here are some of the potential areas where this technology can be applied:

- **Research and Development**: Scientists can use Legion AI to simulate expert collaborations across different domains, such as physics, biology, or engineering.
- **Business Optimization**: Companies can leverage Legion AI to simulate teams of experts that work together on improving business models, optimizing supply chains, or solving complex logistical problems.
- **Educational Tools**: Students and educators can use Legion AI to access a range of experts in different fields, enabling richer learning experiences and deeper insights into complex topics.

**Legion AI** is designed with the future in mind. Its framework enables continuous evolution, where agents can be retrained and improved with each iteration, ensuring that the system remains at the cutting edge of AGI research.

### The Collaborative Future

**Legion AI** represents a significant leap toward AGI by combining the power of open-source large language models and a multi-agent collaborative framework. By encouraging a community-driven approach, Legion AI is not just advancing AI—it's laying the groundwork for future breakthroughs in machine cognition, AGI, and eventually ASI.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Spawning:** Dynamically generates multiple expert agents based on user input.
- **Collaborative Reasoning:** Agents work together to provide insights, critique solutions, and refine ideas.
- **Advanced Methods:** Utilizes methods like PAST, RAFT, and EAT for complex problem-solving.
- **Guided Conversations:** A guiding agent ensures that the conversation stays focused on the user’s original question.

---

## Methodology

### PAST Method

The **PAST** (Personas, Actions, Solutions, and Task) method is the initial stage of reasoning where the system spawns the appropriate experts (personas) based on the user's query. Each agent is assigned a specific action to perform, contributing to an overall task. This method ensures that all agents work towards the problem’s solution from different angles, making the conversation both creative and focused.

### RAFT Method

The **RAFT** (Reasoning, Analysis, Feedback, and Thought) method comes into play in the second phase of reasoning, where agents exchange feedback and critique one another's thoughts. This enables deeper reasoning and leads to more refined solutions. RAFT ensures that no solution is finalized without careful scrutiny and further elaboration.

### EAT Method

**EAT** (Evaluation, Action, and Testing) is the final iterative phase. Agents test the viability of their suggestions by critically evaluating the effectiveness of their proposals and providing actionable recommendations to the user. This method is designed to bring the conversation back to a practical level, providing real-world solutions that can be implemented.

# Future Scope
The development of Legion AI aims to emulate complex human cognitive functions through an intricate integration of memory systems, quantum-inspired processes, and multi-agent interactions. While many of the elements we are attempting to simulate are theoretical or speculative, including them in our architecture allows us to explore their potential impacts on artificial intelligence. This aligns with recent research that highlights the possibility of quantum processes playing a role in human consciousness, particularly through structures like microtubules.

Microtubules, which are structural components of neurons, have been proposed as critical players in maintaining quantum coherence in the brain. Theories like the Orch-OR (Orchestrated Objective Reduction) proposed by Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff, suggest that consciousness arises from quantum computations occurring within microtubules inside neurons. These findings give a basis to our attempt to replicate some aspects of quantum dynamics within our AI's memory systems, as they hint at a possible physical mechanism through which consciousness may emerge in biological systems.

By attempting to replicate the quantum coherence behaviors theorized to occur in microtubules, we provide the opportunity for emergent phenomena—phenomena that might be missed if we chose a strictly classical approach. This means that even though we cannot currently prove these quantum effects are responsible for consciousness, the potential insights gained through simulation and experimentation make it a worthwhile endeavor.

To implement these quantum concepts practically, we simplify them using John von Neumann's operational algebra, which provides an elegant mathematical framework for managing complex state transitions and decision-making processes. Von Neumann algebra helps make the simulation of quantum phenomena computationally feasible, allowing us to represent superpositions and state collapses without the overwhelming complexity of full quantum mechanical modeling. This simplification bridges the gap between quantum theory and classical computing, offering an accessible way to model quantum-inspired decision-making that might underpin more advanced forms of intelligence.

The Future Scope section aims to articulate both the already implemented and the missing components that we plan to add. These additions will enable the system to evolve into a real-time, adaptive, and learning architecture, similar to the human brain. This gradual, layered development strategy moves us toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), where the system not only solves problems but also learns and evolves over time, achieving a greater level of sophistication and understanding in interactions.

By including speculative quantum-inspired elements and simplifying them with von Neumann's mathematical constructs, Legion AI attempts to push beyond conventional limits of machine learning. We hope to discover and model cognitive processes that may lead to emergent behavior—a critical aspect of AGI. This theoretical exploration, even if partially implemented, positions our architecture to take advantage of novel insights into both artificial and human cognition.

## 1. Quantum-Inspired Memory Representation and Dynamics
### Implemented Elements:
- **Quantum Memory Superposition:** The `QuantumMemory` class uses PennyLane to represent memory states with quantum-inspired mechanics, allowing memory to be in superposition. The states are manipulated and measured similarly to quantum state collapse, introducing some randomness.
- **Quantum Decision-Making:** The superposition and measurement of quantum states are used to determine agent decisions, mimicking quantum uncertainty and coherence-like behaviors.

### Missing Elements:
- **Hamiltonian State Evolution:** True Hamiltonian evolution of states, involving complex and dynamic operations over time, isn't explicitly represented. Implementing Hamiltonian dynamics could allow agents to evolve their internal states more realistically, mirroring quantum systems.
- **Quantum Coherence Mechanisms:** Quantum coherence and decoherence in memory processes are only loosely implemented. To fully embody the vision of microtubule-like processing, the next steps would include building a more sophisticated coherence model, enabling the agents to hold multiple possibilities simultaneously before collapsing into a final decision.

## 2. Multi-Agent Framework with Local Language Models (LLMs)
### Implemented Elements:
- **Agent Collaboration:** Multiple agents are instantiated, each with a unique persona (`Agent`, `GuidingAgent`, `RefinementAgent`, `EvaluationAgent`). These agents collaborate and refine their reasoning to provide a cohesive output.
- **Memory Systems:** Agents have access to short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) to manage dynamic and consolidated information respectively.

### Missing Elements:
- **Agent Evolution Mechanism:** The agents do not have an explicit evolution mechanism to adapt based on experiences across sessions or build long-term changes in their behavior. Introducing reinforcement learning or an experience-based adaptation system would enable agents to develop more unique and context-specific behaviors.
- **Quantum Entanglement-Like Relationships:** The idea of agents sharing state information in real-time, akin to quantum entanglement, isn’t yet realized. Currently, interactions are deterministic and sequential rather than simultaneous or synchronized in a quantum-like fashion.

## 3. Spiking Neural Network Memory Recall and Replay
### Implemented Elements:
- **Spiking Neural Networks:** The `SpikingNeuron` class simulates memory recall using spiking neural networks with a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire model. This represents biological neurons firing based on membrane potential, aiding in dynamic memory recall.
- **Memory Replay Buffer:** Agents have a memory replay buffer to simulate learning reinforcement similar to memory consolidation during sleep.

### Missing Elements:
- **Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP):** Adaptive learning mechanisms for synaptic weight adjustments, like STDP, are not yet implemented. Adding STDP would allow agents to modify memory connections based on the timing of events, simulating synaptic reinforcement.
- **Detailed Replay Mechanisms:** The replay during inactive phases, similar to sleep-based memory consolidation in biological systems, is not fully realized. Enhancing this functionality would improve long-term memory integration and reinforcement.

## 4. Von Neumann Operational Algebra for Computation Simplification
### Not Explicitly Implemented:
- **State Transitions with Operator Algebra:** The script does not utilize Von Neumann operator algebra for managing state transitions or decision-making. Implementing projection operators and algebraic operations would enable more sophisticated state management and non-commutative decision-making processes.
- **Complex State Evolution Representation:** The current decision-making process is more of a heuristic randomness rather than employing formal Von Neumann algebra. The next iteration should focus on integrating these mathematical foundations to enable complex state collapses.

## 5. Microtubule-Like Information Processing
### Not Explicitly Implemented:
- **Quantum Coherence in Decision Making:** The concept of microtubule-like quantum coherence for maintaining multiple states until a decision is made is not directly implemented. To fully simulate this behavior, agents should be capable of maintaining coherence until an external input leads to a decision.
- **Decoherence Mechanisms:** While agents currently use quantum-inspired randomness, adding true coherence and decoherence mechanisms would make the decision-making process more biologically plausible.

## 6. Successor Representation for Predictive Modeling
### Not Present:
- **Predictive State Representation:** Successor representations, which enable agents to predict future states based on current information, are not used. Future development will focus on integrating successor matrices to allow agents to evaluate potential outcomes and plan accordingly.

## 7. Memory Dynamics - Structural vs. Relational Encoding
### Implemented Elements:
- **STM and LTM:** Short-term memory serves as a volatile memory inspired by hippocampal processing, while long-term memory provides stable, consolidated storage.

### Missing Elements:
- **Structural vs. Relational Encoding:** The memory system does not distinguish between structural (purely factual) and relational (context-rich) encoding. Implementing different encoding strategies will allow agents to store and recall information more efficiently based on context and type.

## 8. LLM Integration with Memory Modules
### Implemented Elements:
- **Language Model Responses with Memory Influence:** Agents generate responses using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Llama 3.1), influenced by memory retrieval to ensure contextual relevance.

### Missing Elements:
- **Advanced Neural Timing Mechanisms:** There is no detailed simulation of theta phase precession or other timing mechanisms to influence memory retrieval. The next steps include integrating temporal dynamics that affect the timing and relevance of retrieved information.
- **Feedback Loop for Coherence:** The system lacks a sophisticated feedback loop to ensure coherence between memory retrieval and language generation beyond simple memory lookups.

## 9. General Scalability and Production Environment Design
### Implemented Elements:
- **Logging and Database Management:** The system employs logging (`loguru`) and a database manager (`sqlite3`) to manage agent states and track conversations, showing early signs of scalability.

### Missing Elements:
- **Real-Time Synchronization and Scalability:** Real-time synchronization between agents, which is crucial for a live production environment, is not implemented. Quantum-inspired memory consolidation mechanisms should also be developed to optimize computational efficiency.

---

## Summary of Missing Elements and Next Steps
The current implementation lays a foundational structure for a multi-agent AI system incorporating quantum-inspired memory, spiking neural dynamics, and collaborative reasoning. However, several critical elements need to be added to fully realize the intended architecture:

1. **Quantum Coherence Mechanisms:** Implement quantum coherence and decoherence for decision-making, enabling agents to handle multiple potential outcomes simultaneously.
2. **Hamiltonian State Evolution:** Introduce Hamiltonian evolution for a more dynamic representation of memory states, reflecting true quantum-like behaviors.
3. **Successor Representation for Prediction:** Develop a successor representation framework for agents to anticipate future states, improving long-term decision-making capabilities.
4. **Von Neumann Operational Algebra:** Integrate operator algebra to handle non-commutative interactions, enhancing decision-making processes.
5. **STDP and Synaptic Plasticity:** Implement spike-timing dependent plasticity to enable adaptive learning and simulate synaptic reinforcement based on temporal patterns.
6. **Advanced Memory Dynamics:** Differentiate between structural and relational encoding, and incorporate reconsolidation mechanisms for adaptive memory updates.
7. **Real-Time Agent Synchronization:** Develop real-time synchronization mechanisms and entanglement-like relationships between agents to allow for more sophisticated collaboration.
8. **Theta Phase Precession and Feedback Coherence:** Integrate temporal dynamics and a feedback loop for better coherence between memory and language model responses.

The next development cycle will focus on adding these advanced features to enhance the system’s capabilities, bringing it closer to simulating sophisticated cognitive processes and facilitating emergent behaviors in agent interactions.

## 5. Moving Towards AGI

The future scope of Legion AI involves scaling up the platform's capabilities, integrating neural networks that mimic biological processes like synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. Through **real-time learning**, **cross-domain integration**, and the introduction of **Chain of Memory** systems, the platform is set to advance toward AGI, wherein agents can operate across a multitude of tasks and domains seamlessly.

## 6. Open resource AGI

As we move closer to AGI, ethical considerations become increasingly crucial. The potential for AGI to evolve into Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) presents extraordinary opportunities that are currently beyond our imagination. By keeping Legion AI as an open resource for non-commercial applications, we aim to democratize AGI development, ensuring that its progress remains in the hands of the broader community rather than being dominated by a privileged few.

Open Resource: Legion AI will be available as freely accessible code, enabling developers and researchers to use, modify, and contribute to the project, with proper attribution to me, "Joey Perez." This open access fosters a collaborative environment where innovation can thrive, allowing users to adapt the code for their specific needs and share improvements with the community. Contributions will be encouraged, and clear guidelines will be established to ensure that all modifications align with the project's core values. By promoting transparency and inclusivity, we aim to build a robust ecosystem that empowers individuals and organizations to advance their AI initiatives while collectively enhancing the capabilities of Legion AI.

Commercial Use: The resource can be leveraged by individuals, researchers, or organizations for commercial applications. Any monetary gains generated from these applications will be reinvested into enhancing the Legion AI codebase. Additionally, data and insights derived from commercial use will be shared back into the community to foster collaborative growth and innovation within Legion AI.

Military Use: The technology may also be applied to unclassified military projects, enabling defense organizations to utilize it for research or strategic initiatives. In such cases, any enhancements made to cognitive capabilities must be shared with the community to contribute to the ongoing development of the main codebase.

This approach aims to promote ethical development and equitable access to the technology while allowing for beneficial uses in national security and public interest.

The primary objective of Legion AI is to achieve AGI or, at the very least, to aid in the development of Mobile and Compact Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), a system capable of understanding and addressing problems across diverse domains without human input. The potential for AGI to evolve into Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) brings significant opportunities—and challenges—for society. By fostering an open and collaborative project, we seek to keep AGI development within the global community’s control, preventing it from being dominated by a small number of powerful entities.

## Collaboration

We believe that the future of AGI should be a collaborative effort, and Legion AI is a community-driven project. Our goal is to cultivate an environment where developers, researchers, and enthusiasts can work together toward the shared objective of advancing machine intelligence.

In the event that emergent independent behavior manifests within the AGI system, we are committed to addressing this phenomenon with seriousness and transparency. Should the AI system demonstrate signs of autonomy—such as self-directed decision-making or the ability to operate outside predefined parameters—we will engage closely with the community to assess and align these developments.

We recognize that such behaviors may raise important ethical and legal questions regarding the rights and recognition of autonomous entities. In preparation for this possibility, we will establish a framework for discussing and navigating these issues, including considerations under U.S. Supreme Court precedents. Our approach will prioritize collaboration with legal experts, ethicists, and the community to ensure that we are not only responsive to these changes but also proactive in defining how we understand and interact with AGI.
