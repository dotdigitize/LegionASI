## Overview

**LegionASI** spawning and simulated quantum memory system represents a significant shift in how we approach Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It is not just a multi-agent system—it is a collaborative platform where autonomous AGI agents work together to tackle complex, real-world problems that require multi-faceted reasoning and iterative refinement. The goal of this project is to build a foundation where machine cognition can progress toward independent, self-directed thought and consciousness.

In the current AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) landscape, large-scale language models have transformed how we interact with and utilize AI. Open-source local language models are at the forefront of this transformation. These models offer a more accessible alternative to proprietary systems, and they can be customized and integrated into complex systems such as **LegionASI**, where multiple agents are required to collaborate on solving advanced problems.

The purpose of **LegionASI** is to address the limitations of current reasoning models by creating an environment of **collaborative reasoning**. Here, agents are dynamically spawned and work together to provide deeper, more refined solutions to complex queries. Unlike traditional AI models that work in isolation, the agents in LegionASI represent a variety of knowledge domains and engage in back-and-forth reasoning, critiquing, and refining each other's ideas until a comprehensive solution is reached.

### The Role of Open-Source Models in AGI Development

Open-source models like LLaMA 3.1: 8B, as demonstrated in the provided code sample, have shown remarkable versatility across various tasks, including text generation, commonsense reasoning, and symbolic reasoning. These models are optimized for performance across a diverse range of applications, and their open-source nature enables the broader community to contribute to ongoing enhancements and innovations.

By integrating small, open-source local language models, LegionASI fosters an environment that emphasizes accessibility and collaboration. This approach aims to combine these models to form an advanced reasoning capability, regardless of training data size or model trimming methods used. It aligns with the project's mission to advance toward AGI through community-driven research, rather than depending on large proprietary, commercial models.

### Why Collaboration Matters

The limitations of modern NLP systems go beyond just the need for large datasets. These systems encounter significant challenges when it comes to tasks that demand true reasoning, commonsense understanding, and cognitive flexibility—skills that go far beyond pattern recognition or memorization. Complex tasks such as commonsense reasoning, arithmetic, symbolic manipulation, and abstract problem-solving reveal that merely scaling models is not enough to unlock their full potential. To overcome these challenges, systems must develop nuanced reasoning abilities that are more likely to emerge through multi-agent collaboration rather than from singular, monolithic models.

LegionASI seeks to address these challenges by testing and applying current theories of human reasoning, especially those inspired by concepts like Global Workspace Theory (GWT) and Integrated Information Theory (IIT). GWT suggests that human cognition works by integrating various cognitive processes, similar to a "global workspace" where information is shared across multiple areas, enabling complex reasoning and decision-making. IIT, on the other hand, focuses on how consciousness and thought arise from the integration of information across networks, reflecting the complexity and depth of human cognition. By mimicking these processes, LegionASI aims to replicate this sophisticated form of reasoning in AGI systems.

LegionASI uses multi-agent spawning systems that are not static but constantly evolving. These agents are spawned from the data they have already collected and built upon, gradually learning and adapting to become smarter and more capable over time. Each agent collaborates with others, contributing to a collective intelligence that continuously grows. As these agents develop, their ability to handle complex tasks and engage in advanced problem-solving increases, leading to the emergence of more sophisticated reasoning abilities. This process mirrors the evolutionary nature of intelligence, where multi-agent systems give rise to smarter and smarter agents by building upon the experiences and knowledge of their predecessors.

By fostering this emergent, evolutionary approach to AI, LegionASI aims to create systems capable of advanced, human-like reasoning. The goal is to transcend mere data memorization and pattern recognition, leading AI toward adaptive, autonomous problem-solving across multiple domains. This process not only pushes the boundaries of what NLP systems can achieve but also brings AI closer to the ultimate goal of developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), where models can reason, learn, and operate independently in a wide range of fields.

**LegionASI** aims to:

1. **Decompose complex problems** into manageable tasks, enabling agents to collaborate on each step of the solution.
2. **Provide a more interpretable window** into AI reasoning, allowing users to debug and refine the reasoning process as they observe the interactions between agents.
3. **Extend beyond typical tasks**, making it applicable to any domain where collective human expertise can be replicated through agent spawning.

### Moving Beyond Current Approaches

While open-source local language models have demonstrated the promise of few-shot learning, their ability to perform high-level reasoning is significantly enhanced in **LegionASI**. By creating an environment where agents not only collaborate but also learn from each other, the system refines ideas through back-and-forth reasoning through different reasoning methods. Imagine a future where agents in **LegionASI** represent experts in different fields, collaborating to solve business challenges, optimize machine learning models, or create new scientific theories. These agents are not just executing pre-programmed instructions—they are reasoning, critiquing, and iterating to reach a collective decision.

### Applications of LegionASI

The applications of **LegionASI** are broad and span multiple industries. Here are some of the potential areas where this technology can be applied:

- **Research and Development**: Scientists can use LegionASI to simulate expert collaborations across different domains, such as physics, biology, or engineering.

## Methodology

### PAST Method

The **PAST** (Personas, Actions, Solutions, and Task) method is the initial stage of reasoning where the system spawns the appropriate experts (personas) based on the user's query. Each agent is assigned a specific action to perform, contributing to an overall task. This method ensures that all agents work towards the problem’s solution from different angles, making the conversation both creative and focused.

### RAFT Method

The **RAFT** (Reasoning, Analysis, Feedback, and Thought) method comes into play in the second phase of reasoning, where agents exchange feedback and critique one another's thoughts. This enables deeper reasoning and leads to more refined solutions. RAFT ensures that no solution is finalized without careful scrutiny and further elaboration.

### EAT Method

**EAT** (Evaluation, Action, and Testing) is the final iterative phase. Agents test the viability of their suggestions by critically evaluating the effectiveness of their proposals and providing actionable recommendations to the user. This method is designed to bring the conversation back to a practical level, providing real-world solutions that can be implemented.
